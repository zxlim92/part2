Running Instructions:
	Run "make" to compile all of the targets.
    Run "make server" to compile the everything and link to server.
    Run "make dijkstra.o" to compile the dijkstra.cpp.
    Run "make digraph.o" to compile the digraph.cpp.
    Run "make server.o" to compile the server.cpp.
    Run "make clean" to delete all the compiled file.

Assumption:
	The software assumes that the edmonton-roads-2.0.txt is in the same directory with the ./server.
    The input file must follow the convention from the Assignment manual, otherwise it will not input the commands
